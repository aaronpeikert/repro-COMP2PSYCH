# Good

* managable roadmap for 2x2h workshop
* attentive, forgiving and technically apt audience
* two people as course instructors -> very good
* slides not really needed
* first 2h also manageble for not so apt audience

# Bad

* slides not used, resulting in some confusion and loss of structure
* one crucial step forgotten (ssh keys, first auth) some not crucial steps forgotten to
* storyline with replication was rushed and unclear
* in review ssh badly placed
* unforseen merge (conflict) after first pull -> vim hell
* difficult to see how much time is needed -> cards not well used
* not enough explanations

# Remedies

* conceptionalize distributed working
* formulate goals more clearly
* switching between life demo & slides causes underuse of slides -> gifs instead of live demo? -> more control + better storyline
* do ssh directly after rmarkdown
* merge (conflict) -> git reset --hard + change of default editor
* no double use of cards -> just yes/no + repeated inquiery of state
