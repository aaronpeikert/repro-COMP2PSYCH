# Questions

* if you do not understand something:
  * it is **always** my fault
  * let me correct it by raising your hand
* if you want to dig deeper:
  * we have a tough schedule, but you will get an answer
  * raise an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/aaronpeikert/repro-COMP2PSYCH/issues/new)
* if I ask a yes-no-question:
  * white card up 🠖 yes
  * black card up🠖 no
  * no card up 🠖 don't care to answer

# Summary: R Markdown

* Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
* RMarkdown lets you combine:
  * code
  * the thoughts that let to it
  * its results

  in a multitude of output formats
* Reproducibility: text, code and results can't get out of sync

# Proof

I like coding, hence:

```{r}
toupper("code yeah!")
```
I like math and substantive psychological theory as well [@stevensPsychophysicalLaw1957]:

$$
E = c \cdot R^k
$$

# Two small things

**Paths**

* relative paths 🠖 reproducible
* absolute paths 🠖 *never* reproducible
* `here::here()` is your friend

**Packages**

* to avoid errors, use plenty of packages
* *always* load packages at the top of a script
* be kind to your reproducers by using `pacman::p_load()`
  * loads many packages at once
  * installs them if needed

# Let's get to work

* duplo 🠖 probably longest chocolate in the world
* repro 🠖 probably shortest multilab study in the world

## Goal

* `~`16 "labs" in this room
* gather data and contribute them to a larger project

# Get your copy

* fork this repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/aaronpeikert/repro-COMP2PSYCH)
* clone your fork
  * click on `clone or download` 🠖 copy
  * open RStudio
  * File 🠖  New Project ... 🠖 Version Control 🠖 Git 🠖 Ctrl + V
* gather data
  * open `R/save.R`
  * admire the use of `pacman` & `here` 😁
  * change `"my_unique_name.csv"` to anything unique (A-z/0-9 only no spaces, please)
  * Ctrl + A (mark everything)
  * Ctrl + Enter (run everything that is marked)
  * Run last line (`write.csv`)

# See and upload your results

* Open `markdown.Rmd` 🠖 Click Knit
* Look for the Git pane in RStudio
* see "☐ ? ? data/raw/my_unique_name.csv"
* click "☐" 🠖 ☑
* click "☑ Commit" above
* type commit message "add my_unique_name data #1"
* click close
* click "⇑ Push"
* authenticate yourself
* if authentification fails, lay back and wait 

# Contribute your results

* open [this repo on GitHub](https://github.com/aaronpeikert/repro-COMP2PSYCH)
  * not your fork but `aaronpeikert/repro-COMP2PSYCH`
* click on "New pull request"
* click on "compare across forks"
* click "Create Pull Request"
* congratulate yourself 🎉

# Summary: Public collaboration with GitHub

* a *fork* is a copy of a repository on GitHub
* to *clone* means to copy something from GitHub to your computer
* a *commit* is a snapshot of all files
* to *push* means to upload your repo to GitHub
* a *pull request* informs someone that you added something of interest

# Ensure the connection to GitHub

* till now we have used `https`
* `https` requires a password depending on the relation between mars and moon
* password may be saved in plain text ≠ secure
* hence we switch to `ssh`
* RStudio 🠖  Tools 🠖 Global Options 🠖 Git/SVN
  * Create RSA-Key ...
  * View public key 🠖 Ctrl + A 🠖 Ctrl + C
* go to [GitHub-Settings/SSH-Keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)
  * New SSH Key
  * Ctrl + V
  * Add SSH key
  * Password
* RStudio 🠖 Alt + Shift + T

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
ssh -T git@github.com
```

# Get all results

* RStudio 🠖 Alt + Shift + T

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git pull git@github.com:aaronpeikert/repro-COMP2PSYCH.git
```

* Git Pane 🠖 Push

# Delete and reclone

* delete the folder `repro-COMP2PSYCH`
* go to your fork on GitHub
* click on `"clone or download"` 🠖 `"Use SSH"` 🠖 copy
* open RStudio
* File 🠖  New Project ... 🠖 Version Control 🠖 Git 🠖 Ctrl + V

# Closer Collaboration

* find groups of 3-4
* give yourself a funny group name
* decide at random who should be the owner

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sample(1:4, 1)
```

* go to the fork of the owner
* Settings 🠖 Manage Access 🠖 Invite a collaborator 🠖 GitHub username
* Rinse and repeat for all group members
* check your e-mail

# Boring Plot

* go to fork of owner 🠖 clone
* owner
  * copy plot into `R/yourgroupname.R`
  * Git Pane 🠖 add `R/yourgroupname.R` 🠖 Commit 🠖 Push
* all
  * Git Pane 🠖 Pull

```{r read, echo=FALSE}
```

```{r}
ggplot(results, aes(diff, time, group = diff)) + geom_boxplot()
```

# More exciting

* everone add something to the plot
* add & commit changes
* expect a big chaos
* push
* pull and merge conflicts
* commit
* resolved conflicts
* push
* rinse and repeat

## Some Suggestions

```{r eval=FALSE}
+ theme_minimal()
+ ylab("Reaction Time")
+ ggtitle("Awesome", "Stephens is right")
+ geom_violin()
+ scale_y_log10()
+ scale_x_log10()
+ facet_wrap(vars(midpoint), nrow = 1)
```

# Summary: Trustfull Collaboration

# Summary: Trustfull Collaboration

**public collaboration**

* everyone has its own copy on GitHub (and locally)
* you only write (push) to the repo you own
* and request others to incorparate your changes (pull request)
* everything is decentrelized

**trustfull collaboration**

* if you trust a user you may grant write access
* users then may push to your repository
* in such setting a central repro on github makes sense
* finegraded conssible with [GitHub Organizations](htttrol pops://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch)

# Contribute your results

* open [this repo on GitHub](https://github.com/aaronpeikert/repro-COMP2PSYCH)
  * not your fork but `aaronpeikert/repro-COMP2PSYCH`
* click on "New pull request"
* click on "compare across forks"
* click "Create Pull Request"
* congratulate yourself 🎉
