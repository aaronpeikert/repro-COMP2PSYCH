```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
if(!requireNamespace("pacman"))install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(fs, here, tidyverse, sessioninfo)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::read_chunk(here("R", "read.R"))
```

We can calculate stuff:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

And get the result. Also we can include formulas:

$$
E = c \cdot R^k
$$

And cite them [see @stevensPsychophysicalLaw1957].

Much more is possible like linking to a [book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/), written in markdown *about* markdown. May I also suggest the **great** [`papja`-package](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) for authoring APA manuscripts?

```{r read}
```

```{r}
ggplot(results, aes(diff, time, group = diff)) + geom_boxplot()+ geom_violin()+ theme_minimal()+
  facet_wrap(~id, scales = "free_y")+
  scale_y_log10()
  NULL
```

```{r}
session_info()$platform
```
